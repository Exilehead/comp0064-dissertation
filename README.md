7.11: Update basic detector bft_detector.py  

7.18: Update detector enabling detecting Attack 3 and 4 on malicious nodes logging dishonest voting messages or not log anything  

Include One set of logs 1_10_1ML and One set of tests showing proof of safety attacks generated by detector  

bft_script.py is for generating 20 logs for One set of attack, planning to get 10 set of attacks  

bft_tester.py is for testing, Have done 3 basic test and 1 advanced test, one more advanced test under construction  

Account "Exilehead" got password issue thus committed with my other account "gaoruize03"  


7.25: Generating 6 types of attacks groups with their logs:  
1. Individual attack  

2. All attacks, one leader for attack 1, 2 for each  

3. All attacks, one leader for attack 1, 2 for each, with some liveness attacks interference  

4. All attacks, multiple leaders for attack 1, 2 for each, with some liveness attacks interference  

5. All attacks, one leader doing both attack 1, 2 at the same round  
With improved precision and recall based on their results. Improvement as bug fixes are included in detector's comment  
Results can be see in result.xls with charts generated for aggregated average and standard deviation for groups of attacks
